CancelPassBlock
===============

Cydia tweak to disable passcode block out by tapping in the top left corner of the screen.
I know there are a couple tweaks that prevent this from happening at all but one of them locked me out of my phone and all my icons went away when I logged in via cycript so I don't trust those anymore :p messing with the lock on the phone means trouble. That's why I did it! (but differently)
This just adds a square (invisible) in the top left corner of the screen that you can tap when it says "iPhone is Disabled" or whatever and it will clear the blocked state. Enjoy :)

NOTE: THIS DOES POTENTIALLY MAKE IT EASIER FOR THIEVES TO TRY AS MANY PASSCODES AS THEY WANT (but who's even going to take them right)
Just have a random password if you're scared of it being cracked.

I do not take any responsibility for you choosing to install this and making your device potentionally insecure.
